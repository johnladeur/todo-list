# todo-list

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a simple To-do list application that I built to reinforce some newly acquired knowledge in JavaScript.  List items can be entered in the Input section and added to the list by either clicking the "Submit" button or by pressing the "Enter" key.  Once list items are created, they can be marked as completed by clicking on the "Done" button and can be removed by clicking the "X" button.
